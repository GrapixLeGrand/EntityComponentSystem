# Entity component system in Libgx

This project contains a small game with a simple character that can move and always face the mouse. I've created an entity component system in Java as a learning experience. There is an object pool that is used in order to avoid excessive object creation. The componenents can be customized and added to the entity without being tight with it.
This software is not meant to be used to solve real world project but as a learning experiment.

To run it out of the box on android or Desktop, open the project with Android Studio. (Require JDK 11)
